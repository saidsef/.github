- Balances reliability with the need for rapid product iteration, sometimes accepting higher risk to enable faster delivery of new features.
- Success is measured by customer-facing reliability metrics and the impact of reliability work on product outcomes.

**DevSecOps Engineer (Product-Focused):**
- Integrates security into the product development lifecycle, ensuring that security features are part of the product roadmap.
- Works with product managers to prioritise security enhancements that improve customer trust and meet market demands.
- Measures success by the security posture of released products and the ability to deliver secure features without impeding product velocity.

### Key Differences in a Product-Focused Context

| Role | Operations-Focused | Product-Focused |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Platform Engineer | Builds and maintains infrastructure for reliability and efficiency | Treats platforms as products, focusing on developer experience and feature enablement |
| DevOps Engineer | Automates operations and deployment processes | Accelerates feature delivery and supports product experimentation |
| Systems Engineer | Ensures system stability and performance | Optimises systems for product-specific requirements and user experience |
| Site Reliability Engineer | Maintains system uptime and reliability | Aligns reliability work with product goals and customer expectations |
| DevSecOps Engineer | Embeds security in operational processes | Integrates security as a product feature and competitive differentiator |

In summary, product-focused engineering roles are more closely aligned with business and customer outcomes, prioritising innovation, user experience, and rapid delivery of new features, whereas operations-focused roles emphasise stability, efficiency, and risk mitigation.

## Conclusion

The emergence of specialised engineering roles reflects the growing complexity of modern IT infrastructure and the need for focused expertise in specific domains. While Platform Engineers create the foundations for development work, DevOps Engineers streamline the development-to-production pipeline, Systems Engineers maintain the underlying technology, SREs ensure systems remain reliable, and DevSecOps Engineers integrate security throughout the process.

These roles, while distinct in their primary focus areas, share many common skills and tools. The differences lie primarily in their emphasis and specific domain expertise rather than in completely separate skillsets. For many organisations, the boundaries between these roles may blur, with professionals taking on aspects of multiple roles depending on team size and business needs.

As technology continues to evolve, these roles will likely continue to shift and adapt. Cloud-native approaches, serverless architectures, and AI-powered operations tools are already influencing how these roles function. Organisations should remain flexible in their team structures, focusing on the outcomes needed rather than rigid role definitions.

The most successful engineering teams will be those that foster collaboration across these specialisations, creating environments where knowledge is shared freely, and collective responsibility for system quality, reliability, and security is embraced by all.
